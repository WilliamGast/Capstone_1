# Capstone 1
## Introduction
As someone who is interested in real-estate inveting I wanted to create a framework for a city that would make show overvalued and undervalued properties within a specific city. I chose New York City for my analysis.
#### About The Data
The data set that I chose is a data set that shows the buildings or building usits sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period

First thing that I did was clean the data and create some new columns to create some new metrics and increase readability. I created a price per square foot column. I also seperated the sales sate column into a day,month and year column

I then anayzed the overal price per square foot between the seperate boroughs of NYC which is shown in the graph below

I then put that same graph into a box plot so that I could visualize the overall distribution of prices per square foot for each borough.
