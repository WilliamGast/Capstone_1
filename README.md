# Capstone 1
## Introduction
As someone who is interested in real-estate inveting I wanted to create a framework for a city that would make show overvalued and undervalued properties within a specific city. I chose New York City for my analysis.
#### About The Data
The data set that I chose is a data set that shows the buildings or building usits sold in the New York City property market over a 12-month period

First thing that I did was clean the data and create some new columns to create some new metrics and increase readability. I created a price per square foot column. I also seperated the sales sate column into a day,month and year column

I then anayzed the overal price per square foot between the seperate boroughs of NYC which is shown in the graph below

</p>

I then put that same graph into a box plot so that I could visualize the overall distribution of prices per square foot for each borough.

After I saw the extreme outliers in the overvaluation of some properties I wanted to do some investigating in the reasons behind the sales. 

### One dolar sales
"The City of New York has a tradition of selling unused property for one dollar to incentivize development, encourage nonprofit developers to apply for the lots, and free the city of maintenance costs. Developers are required to submit specific housing plans for the property and need to show that they have the funds to execute. New York City’s Department of Housing Preservation and Development sold 700 buildings for a dollar between 2002 and 2006, though the pace has decreased considerably since then as the city’s stock of ownership has declined." -NYU Furman Center
